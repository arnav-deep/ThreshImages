# ThreshImages

Python scripts for thresholding images using common thresholding methods.

Instead of directly using the library, here, the functions for threshold coding are directly written for each method in each script.

## Setup

Open termina in project directory and install the requirements.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

The requirements are only used for basic functionality's like reading the image, converting it to black and white, displaying the image, and a simple histogram function for Otsu's method.

## The Threshhold Methods

The following threshold methods have been applied here.

### Li's iterative Minimum Cross Entropy method

This method has been applied in [```thresh_lis.py```](https://github.com/arnav-deep/ThreshImages/blob/main/thresh_lis.py).

  * How to run:
  
      ```python thresh_lis.py <image_filename>```

### Local thresholding method

This method has been applied in [```thresh_local.py```](https://github.com/arnav-deep/ThreshImages/blob/main/thresh_local.py).

  * How to run:
  
      ```python thresh_local.py <image_filename>```

### Li's iterative Minimum Cross Entropy method

This method has been applied in [```thresh_lis.py```](https://github.com/arnav-deep/ThreshImages/blob/main/thresh_lis.py).

All 4 methods ahve been applied â€”

    * Generic
    * Gaussian
    * Mean
    * Median

  * How to run:
  
      ```python thresh_lis.py <image_filename> <method_name>```
